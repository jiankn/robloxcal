    "faqs": [
        {
            "question": "When should I rebirth in Escape Tsunami For Brainrots?",
            "answer": "Rebirth when the break-even time is less than 30 minutes. This calculator helps you determine the optimal rebirth timing based on your current income and the new multiplier you'll receive."
        },
        {
            "question": "How does the money multiplier work in Escape Tsunami?",
            "answer": "The money multiplier increases all your earnings by that factor. A 2x multiplier means you earn double the base amount. Each rebirth level increases this multiplier."
        },
        {
            "question": "What is break-even time?",
            "answer": "Break-even time is how long it takes for the increased earnings from rebirthing to make up for the time lost resetting your progress. Shorter break-even times mean rebirthing is more worthwhile."
        },
        {
            "question": "Should I always rebirth when available?",
            "answer": "Not necessarily. Only rebirth when the multiplier gain is significant enough. Use this calculator to determine if the break-even time is acceptable for your play session."
        },
        {
            "question": "How do I check my current multiplier in game?",
            "answer": "Open your stats menu in Escape Tsunami For Brainrots. Your current money multiplier should be displayed there, along with your rebirth level."
        },
        {
            "question": "Does rebirth reset my speed upgrades?",
            "answer": "This depends on the game's specific rebirth mechanics. Generally, some upgrades are permanent while others reset. Check the in-game rebirth info for details."
        },
        {
            "question": "What's the best rebirth strategy for beginners?",
            "answer": "For beginners, rebirth early and often when the multiplier gain is 0.5x or more. As you progress, be more selective since recovery times increase."
