'# Anime Guardians - Complete Unit Tier List

Updated for Update 22.5 (January 2026). This comprehensive tier list ranks every unit by overall tower defense effectiveness, considering damage output, utility, and team synergy.

## Tier List Overview

### Tier Definitions

- **SS Tier**: God-tier units. Best in game, game-changing abilities.
- **S Tier**: Excellent units. Top picks for any content.
- **A Tier**: Great units. Solid choices for most situations.
- **B Tier**: Good units. Situational but useful.
- **C Tier**: Average units. Early game or filler only.

## SS Tier - God Tier

These units are the absolute best in Anime Guardians. Obtain any of these and your account is set.

### Gojo Satoru (Jujutsu Kaisen)

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| DPS | ★★★★★ |
| AoE | ★★★★★ |
| Utility | ★★★★☆ |
| Survivability | ★★★★★ |
| Overall | **10/10** |

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Infinity**: Reduces all incoming damage by 90%
- **Domain Expansion**: Massive AoE that stuns and damages all enemies

**Why SS Tier**:
Gojo combines the highest DPS in the game with near-invincibility through Infinity. His Domain Expansion clears entire waves single-handedly. There is no content in the game that Gojo cannot trivialize.

**Recommended Build**: 4pc Destroyer Set, ATK% main stat, Crit substats

**Team Placement**: Any position, preferably center for max coverage

### Muzan Kibutsuji (Demon Slayer)

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| DPS | ★★★★★ |
| AoE | ★★★★☆ |
| Utility | ★★★★★ |
| Survivability | ★★★★★ |
| Overall | **10/10** |

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Blood Demon Art**: Devastating multi-target attacks
- **Regeneration**: Auto-heal 10% HP every 5 seconds

**Why SS Tier**:
Muzan is effectively unkillable due to Regeneration while dealing top-tier damage. His sustain allows aggressive positioning that other units cannot survive.

**Recommended Build**: 4pc Guardian + Vampiric traits

**Best Paired With**: Any team - Muzan is universally excellent

### Madara Uchiha (Naruto)

| Category | Rating |
|----------|--------|
| DPS | ★★★★★ |
| AoE | ★★★★★ |
| Utility | ★★★★☆ |
| Survivability | ★★★☆☆ |
| Overall | **9.5/10** |

**Signature Abilities**:
- **Susanoo**: Massive damage boost
- **Meteor Drop**: Highest single-hit AoE damage in game

**Why SS Tier**:
Madara''s Meteor is the most powerful AoE ability available. It can eliminate entire boss health bars and clear packed waves instantly. Lower survivability is his only weakness.

**Recommended Build**: Glass cannon - pure ATK and Crit

**Positioning**: Protected back row - keep him alive for Meteor

## S Tier - Excellent

Top-tier picks that excel in most content.

| Stat | Rating |
|------|--------|
| DPS | ★★★★☆ |
| Consistency | ★★★★★ |
| Overall | **8.5/10** |

**Why S Tier**: Most consistent DPS output. Sun Breathing burns enemies over time. Excellent value for investment.

| Stat | Rating |
|------|--------|
| DPS | ★★★★☆ |

## What Are Artifacts?

Artifacts are equippable items that provide:

Each unit has artifact slots:

| Slot | Primary Stat Focus |
|------|-------------------|
| Weapon | ATK%, Crit Rate |
| Armor | DEF%, HP% |
| Accessory | Speed%, Special |

### Main Stats

Artifacts have one main stat that scales with level:

| Stat Type | Max Value (Mythic) |
|-----------|-------------------|
| ATK% | +75-100% |
| HP% | +75-100% |
| DEF% | +75-100% |
| Speed% | +40-50% |
| Crit Rate% | +30-40% |

### Sub Stats

Up to 4 sub stats provide additional bonuses:

- Flat ATK
- Flat HP

| Common | +5-10% | 1 | None |
| Uncommon | +10-20% | 1-2 | Minor |
| Rare | +20-35% | 2-3 | Moderate |
| Epic | +35-50% | 3 | Strong |
| Legendary | +50-75% | 3-4 | Powerful |
| Mythic | +75-100% | 4 | Ultimate |

**Pro Tip**: Don''t invest in anything below Epic quality.

## Artifact Sets

**For Support Units**:

- Priority: Speed main, HP sub stats

**For Tank Units**:

- Priority: HP% main, DEF% sub stats

## Optimal Builds by Unit

### Gojo Satoru Build

| Slot | Set | Main Stat | Target Subs |
|------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Weapon | Destroyer | ATK% | Crit Rate, Crit DMG |
| Armor | Destroyer | HP% | Speed, DEF% |
| Acc 1 | Destroyer | ATK% | Crit Rate, ATK Flat |

### Sukuna Build

|------|-----|-----------|-------------|
| Weapon | Assassin | ATK% | Crit Rate, Crit DMG |
| Armor | Assassin | ATK% | Speed, Crit DMG |
| Acc 1 | Assassin | Crit Rate | ATK%, Crit DMG |
| Acc 2 | Assassin | Crit DMG | ATK%, Crit Rate |

**Why Assassin**: Sukuna benefits most from critical builds due to burst nature.

| Acc 1 | Swift | Speed | ATK%, Crit |

## Enhancement System

### Leveling Artifacts

Artifacts gain stats through enhancement:

| Level | Stat Increase | Fodder Required |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1-4 | +5% per level | Low |
| 5-8 | +7% per level | Medium |
| 9-12 | +10% per level | High |
| 13-16 | +12% per level | Very High |
| 17-20 | +15% per level | Extreme |

**Max Level by Rarity**:
- Common: 4
- Uncommon: 8
- Rare: 12
- Epic: 16
- Legendary: 18
- Mythic: 20

### Enhancement Priority

1. **Weapon artifacts first** - biggest DPS gain
2. **Main DPS unit complete** - before spreading resources
3. **+16 minimum** before moving to next piece
4. **Mythic only** for max investment

## Rerolling Substats

Sub stats can be rerolled using tokens:

### When to Reroll

**DO Reroll**:
- Mythic artifacts with bad subs
- Good main stat, 1-2 bad subs
- Endgame optimization

**DON''T Reroll**:
- Epic or below (not worth)
- Artifacts with 3+ good subs
- Limited tokens

### Reroll Strategy

1. Lock good sub stats (if feature available)
2. Target worst sub stat
3. Stop when you get 3+ useful subs
4. Perfect rolls are luxury, not necessity

## Farming Artifacts

### Sources

| Source | Drop Quality |
|--------|-------------|
| Story Mode | Common-Rare |
| Infinite Tower | Rare-Legendary |
| Raid Battles | Epic-Mythic |
| Events | Legendary-Mythic |
| Shop | Guaranteed quality |

### Efficient Farming

1. **Focus Raids** for best drops
2. **Complete Events** for guaranteed Mythic
3. **Don''t farm story** after completion
4. **Save shop currency** for Mythic pieces

## Common Mistakes

1. **Investing in Common-Rare** - Wasted resources
2. **Ignoring Sub Stats** - Subs matter more than main at high levels
3. **Wrong Sets** - Destroyer on tanks = terrible
4. **Spreading Resources** - Max one unit before moving on
5. **Skipping Set Bonuses** - 4pc bonuses are huge

## Artifact Calculator

- Calculate total stat bonuses
- Compare set combinations
