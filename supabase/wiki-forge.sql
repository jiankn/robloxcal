## What is The Forge?

The Forge is an immersive crafting and combat game on Roblox where players mine ores, forge weapons and armor, and battle enemies with their crafted equipment. The game features a deep crafting system where the quality of your materials directly affects the power of your gear.

### Core Game Features

**Mining System**
The foundation of The Forge is mining. Players explore various locations to gather ores of different tiers, each with unique properties and value multipliers:
- **Starter Areas**: Copper, Iron, Gold
- **Mid-Game Zones**: Diamond, Emerald
- **End-Game Locations**: Ruby, Obsidian, Mythril

**Forging Mechanics**
The heart of the game is the forge itself. Combine ores to create weapons and armor:
- **Weapons**: Damage-focused equipment
- **Armor**: Defense-focused equipment
- **Accessories**: Utility items (advanced)

**Combat System**
Test your crafted gear against increasingly difficult enemies:
- Dungeon runs
- Boss battles
- PvP arenas
- Wave survival

**Trait System**
Equipment can roll special traits that dramatically enhance their effectiveness:
- Common traits: +15-20% stat bonuses
- Rare traits: Special effects like lifesteal
- Legendary traits: +50% all stats

### Core Gameplay Loop

The Forge follows a satisfying progression:

1. **Mine Ores** - Gather materials from various locations
2. **Return to Forge** - Process ores into equipment
3. **Equip Gear** - Put on your new weapons/armor
4. **Battle Enemies** - Test equipment and earn rewards
5. **Explore Further** - Unlock new mining areas

## Key Game Systems Explained

### Ore Tier System

The Forge features 8 ore tiers, each with increasing power:

| Tier | Ore | Multiplier | Location | Level Req |
|------|-----|------------|----------|-----------|
| 1 | Copper | 1.0x | Starter Cave | 1 |
| 2 | Iron | 1.5x | Starter Cave | 1 |
| 3 | Gold | 2.0x | Forest Mine | 5 |
| 4 | Diamond | 3.0x | Crystal Caverns | 10 |
| 5 | Emerald | 4.0x | Jungle Mines | 20 |
| 6 | Ruby | 5.0x | Volcano | 35 |
| 7 | Obsidian | 7.0x | Nether | 50 |
| 8 | Mythril | 10.0x | Pirate Island | 60 |

**Pro Tip**: Focus on the highest tier ore you can efficiently farm!

### Equipment Class System

The quality of crafted equipment depends on total ore value:

| Class | Value Req | Stats | Trait Slots |
|-------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Common | 0+ | Base | 1 |
| Uncommon | 50+ | +25% | 1 |
| Rare | 150+ | +50% | 2 |
| Epic | 400+ | +100% | 2-3 |
| Legendary | 800+ | +200% | 3 |
| Mythic | 1500+ | +400% | 3-4 |

Use our [Forge Calculator](/the-forge/forge-calculator) to predict equipment class!

### Forging Value Formula

Equipment value is calculated as:
```
Value = OreCount × OreMultiplier × TierBonus
```

Where TierBonus = Tier × 2

**Example**: 20 Mythril ores
- OreCount: 20
- OreMultiplier: 10.0
- TierBonus: 8 × 2 = 16
- Total Value: 20 × 10.0 × 16 = **3200** → Mythic class!

### Trait System Details

Traits are randomly assigned when forging. Higher tier ores increase trait chances:

| Trait | Effect | Base Chance |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| Sharp | +15% Damage | 20% |
| Sturdy | +20% Defense | 20% |
| Swift | +10% Attack Speed | 15% |
| Vampiric | 5% Lifesteal | 10% |
| Explosive | AoE Damage | 8% |
| **Legendary** | +50% All Stats | 2% |

**Trait Chance Boost**: Higher tier ores add +2% per tier to trait chances.

'# The Forge - Complete Forging Guide

Master the art of forging to create the most powerful equipment in The Forge. This guide covers everything from basic crafting to advanced optimization techniques.

## Forging Fundamentals

### What is Forging?

Forging is the process of converting raw ores into weapons, armor, and accessories. The quality of your output depends on:

1. **Ore Quantity**: More ores = higher value
2. **Ore Quality**: Higher tier ores = better multipliers
3. **RNG**: Trait rolls add variance

### The Forging Process

1. **Collect Ores** - Mine from various locations
2. **Visit Blacksmith** - Located in the main hub
3. **Select Craft Type** - Weapon, Armor, or Accessory
4. **Choose Ores** - Select which ores to use
5. **Forge!** - RNG determines traits
6. **Equip** - Put on your new gear

### Forging Interface

The forge interface shows:
- **Ore Inventory**: Available ores
- **Predicted Value**: Estimated equipment value
- **Predicted Class**: Expected quality tier
- **Craft Options**: Weapon/Armor/Accessory

## Equipment Classes Explained

### Class Requirements and Stats

| Class | Value | Damage/Def Boost | Trait Slots |
|-------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Common | 0-49 | Base | 1 |
| Uncommon | 50-149 | +25% | 1 |
| Rare | 150-399 | +50% | 2 |
| Epic | 400-799 | +100% | 2-3 |
| Legendary | 800-1499 | +200% | 3 |
| Mythic | 1500+ | +400% | 3-4 |

**Key Insight**: The jump from Legendary to Mythic is massive (+200% → +400%).

### Value Thresholds

Important value targets to remember:

- **50**: Uncommon threshold
- **150**: Rare threshold
- **400**: Epic threshold
- **800**: Legendary threshold
- **1500**: Mythic threshold

## Weapon vs Armor Crafting

### Weapons

Weapons prioritize damage stats:

| Stat | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| Damage | ForgeValue × 0.8 |
| Attack Speed | Base (1.0) + Traits |
| Durability | ForgeValue × 0.5 + (Tier × 10) |

**Best For**: Offensive builds, boss killing, PvP

### Armor

Armor prioritizes defense:

| Stat | Calculation |
|------|-------------|
| Defense | ForgeValue × 0.9 |
| HP Bonus | ForgeValue × 0.3 |
| Durability | ForgeValue × 0.6 + (Tier × 10) |

**Best For**: Tanking, survival, difficult content

### Recommendation

**Early Game**: Prioritize weapons (kill faster = farm faster)
**Mid Game**: Balance both weapon and armor
**End Game**: Perfect both with ideal traits

## Trait System Deep Dive

### Trait Types

Each trait provides unique bonuses:

**Damage Traits**:
- **Sharp**: +15% Damage
- **Fierce**: +10% Critical Chance
- **Explosive**: AoE damage on hit

**Defense Traits**:
- **Sturdy**: +20% Defense
- **Vitality**: +15% Max HP
- **Resilient**: -10% Damage Taken

**Utility Traits**:
- **Swift**: +10% Attack Speed
- **Vampiric**: 5% Lifesteal
- **Lucky**: +10% Drop Rate

**Ultimate Trait**:
- **Legendary**: +50% ALL Stats (2% chance)

### Trait Probability

Base trait chances + ore tier bonus:

| Trait | Base % | With Tier 8 Ore |
|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Sharp | 20% | 36% (+16%) |
| Sturdy | 20% | 36% (+16%) |
| Swift | 15% | 31% (+16%) |
| Vampiric | 10% | 26% (+16%) |
| Explosive | 8% | 24% (+16%) |
| Legendary | 2% | 18% (+16%) |

**Formula**: FinalChance = BaseChance + (OreTier × 2%)

### Trait Slot Count

Higher value = more trait slots:

| Value Range | Slots |
|-------------|-------|
| 0-149 | 1 |
| 150-399 | 2 |
| 400-799 | 2-3 |
| 800-1499 | 3 |
| 1500+ | 3-4 |

## Optimal Forging Strategies

### Strategy 1: Batch Forging

Never forge high-tier ores in small amounts:

**BAD Example**:
- 5 Mythril ores
- Value: 5 × 160 = 800
- Result: Barely Legendary, 3 trait slots

**GOOD Example**:
- 15 Mythril ores
- Value: 15 × 160 = 2400
- Result: Strong Mythic, 3-4 trait slots

### Strategy 2: Tier Targeting

Target specific equipment classes:

| Goal | Ore Needed (Mythril) |
|------|---------------------|
| Legendary | 5 (800 value) |
| Mythic | 10 (1600 value) |
| Strong Mythic | 15 (2400 value) |
| Perfect Mythic | 20+ (3200+ value) |

### Strategy 3: Trait Rerolling

Use reroll tokens strategically:

1. Only reroll Legendary/Mythic gear
2. Stop if you get 2+ good traits
3. Save rerolls for Legendary trait attempts

## Best Forging Builds

### DPS Build

**Weapon Traits to Target**:
- Sharp (+15% DMG)
- Swift (+10% SPD)
- Legendary (+50% All) if lucky

**Armor Traits**:
- Swift (+10% SPD)
- Vampiric (sustain)

### Tank Build

**Armor Traits to Target**:
- Sturdy (+20% DEF)
- Vitality (+15% HP)
- Resilient (-10% DMG taken)

**Weapon Traits**:
- Vampiric (healing)
- Any defensive trait

### Balanced Build

**Weapon**:
- Sharp + Swift

**Armor**:
- Sturdy + Vampiric

## Common Forging Mistakes

1. **Forging Too Early** - Wasting high-tier ores on low-value crafts
2. **Ignoring Traits** - Traits matter as much as base stats
3. **Wrong Priorities** - Weapons before armor in early game
4. **Not Batching** - Small forges waste potential
5. **Reroll Wasting** - Using rerolls on non-Mythic gear
