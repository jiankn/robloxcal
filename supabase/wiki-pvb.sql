'# Plants Vs Brainrots Wiki - Complete Guide 2026

Welcome to the ultimate Plants Vs Brainrots Wiki! This comprehensive guide covers everything from basic gameplay mechanics to advanced damage optimization strategies that will help you dominate the battlefield.

## What is Plants Vs Brainrots?

Plants Vs Brainrots is an exciting tower defense-style game on Roblox where players must strategically grow and position plants to defend against waves of attacking brainrots. The game combines classic tower defense mechanics with unique plant abilities, mutations, and upgrade systems that create deep strategic gameplay.

### Core Game Features

**Strategic Plant Placement**
Success in Plants Vs Brainrots depends heavily on where you place your plants. Front-line plants like Wall-nuts absorb damage while back-line damage dealers like Gatling Pea eliminate threats from safety. Understanding lane control and plant synergies is essential for surviving harder waves.

**Mutation System**
One of the most exciting features is the mutation system. Plants can spawn with rare mutations that dramatically increase their effectiveness:
- **Gold Mutation**: 1.5x damage multiplier with golden visual effects
- **Diamond Mutation**: 2.0x damage multiplier with sparkling blue particles
- **Neon Mutation**: 2.5x damage multiplier with glowing outlines
- **Frozen Mutation**: 3.0x damage multiplier plus additional slow effects on enemies

**Economy Management**
Sunflowers and other economy plants generate resources that let you purchase more powerful plants. Balancing offense and economy is crucial - too few Sunflowers means you cannot afford upgrades, but too many leaves you vulnerable to enemy attacks.

### Core Gameplay Loop

The game follows a satisfying progression loop:

1. **Plant Seeds** - Select and place defensive plants on the field
2. **Defend Waves** - Plants automatically attack incoming brainrots
3. **Earn Rewards** - Defeated brainrots drop cash and resources
4. **Upgrade & Expand** - Purchase better seeds and unlock mutations
5. **Progress Further** - Take on increasingly difficult challenges

## Key Game Systems Explained

### Plant Damage (DPS) System

Understanding DPS (Damage Per Second) is essential for optimizing your garden. Plant damage is calculated using this formula:

```
DPS = BaseDamage × AttackSpeed × MutationMultiplier × BonusMultipliers
```

For example, a Frozen Gatling Pea calculates as:
- Base Damage: 80
- Attack Speed: 1.5 attacks/second
- Frozen Mutation: 3.0x
- **Total DPS: 80 × 1.5 × 3.0 = 360 DPS**

Use our [DPS Calculator](/plants-vs-brainrots/pvb-dps-calculator) to optimize your plant builds!

### Plant Tier Rankings

Plants are categorized by their overall effectiveness:

| Tier | Plants | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **S Tier** | Winter Melon, Gatling Pea | Best plants in the game, massive DPS and utility |
| **A Tier** | Repeater, Torchwood, Chomper | Excellent choices for most situations |
| **B Tier** | Snow Pea, Peashooter | Solid early-game options with good value |
| **C Tier** | Sunflower, Wall-nut | Essential utility but low direct damage |

Check our complete [Plant Tier List](/plants-vs-brainrots/pvb-tier-list) for detailed rankings!

### Mutation Drop Rates

Understanding mutation chances helps you plan your strategy:

| Mutation | Drop Rate | Effect |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Normal | 85.5% | Standard plant with no bonus |
| Gold | 10% | 1.5x damage multiplier |
| Diamond | 3% | 2.0x damage multiplier |
| Neon | 1% | 2.5x damage multiplier |
| Frozen | 0.5% | 3.0x damage + slow effect |

**Pro Tip**: Lucky Potions from codes temporarily boost mutation chances!

'# Plants Vs Brainrots - Complete Plant Guide

This comprehensive guide covers every plant in Plants Vs Brainrots, including detailed stats, abilities, optimal strategies, and synergy combinations. Understanding each plant''s strengths and weaknesses is essential for mastering the game.

## Understanding Plant Stats

Before diving into individual plants, let''s understand the key stats:

- **Base Damage**: Raw damage dealt per attack
- **Attack Speed**: Attacks per second
- **DPS**: Damage Per Second (Damage × Speed)
- **Cost**: Sun required to plant
- **Special**: Unique abilities or effects

## Common Plants

Common plants are your bread and butter - affordable, accessible, and essential for any garden.

### Peashooter - The Foundation

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 20 |
| Attack Speed | 1.5/s |
| DPS | 30 |
| Cost | 100 sun |
| Range | Full lane |

**In-Depth Analysis**

The Peashooter is your first plant and remains useful throughout the game. While its raw DPS is modest, its low cost and reliable performance make it a staple in early game strategies.

**Optimal Placement**: Place Peashooters in the middle rows behind Wall-nuts. They work best in groups of 2-3 per lane.

**Synergy Partners**:
- **Torchwood**: Doubles pea damage when shots pass through
- **Snow Pea**: Slowed enemies take more hits from Peashooter

**Mutation Priority**: Medium. Peashooters benefit from mutations but are eventually replaced by Repeaters.

### Sunflower - The Economy Engine

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 5 |
| Attack Speed | 2.0/s |
| Sun Production | 50 sun/15 seconds |
| Cost | 50 sun |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Sunflowers are absolutely essential. Without them, you cannot afford the powerful plants needed to survive later waves. The general rule is: if you''re struggling to buy plants, add more Sunflowers.

**Optimal Placement**: Always in the back row, protected by all other plants. Never sacrifice Sunflowers.

**Economy Math**:
- 1 Sunflower = 200 sun per minute
- 3 Sunflowers = 600 sun per minute
- This funds approximately 2-3 mid-tier plants per minute

**Pro Tip**: Start every game with 2 Sunflowers before placing any offensive plants.

### Wall-nut - The Guardian

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 0 |
| Health | 500 HP |
| Cost | 75 sun |
| Special | Blocks all ground enemies |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Wall-nuts are pure defense - they deal no damage but absorb enormous amounts of enemy attacks. A single Wall-nut can block an entire lane of brainrots while your damage dealers eliminate them safely.

**Optimal Placement**: Front row, one per lane at minimum. Replace immediately when destroyed.

**Health Conservation**: Wall-nuts can be "healed" by planting a new one on top of a damaged one, refreshing its health pool.

## Uncommon Plants

Uncommon plants offer specialized abilities that can turn the tide of battle.

### Snow Pea - The Crowd Controller

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 20 |
| Attack Speed | 1.5/s |
| DPS | 30 |
| Cost | 175 sun |
| Special | Slows enemies by 50% |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Snow Pea''s true value isn''t its damage - it''s the 50% slow effect. Slowed enemies spend twice as long in your kill zone, effectively doubling your garden''s total damage output.

**Optimal Strategy**: One Snow Pea per lane is enough for the slow effect. Stack additional damage dealers behind it.

**Critical Synergy**: Snow Pea + Gatling Pea is devastating. The slow ensures every Gatling Pea shot lands.

### Chomper - The Assassin

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 150 (instant kill) |
| Attack Speed | 0.5/s (with eating time) |
| Cost | 150 sun |
| Special | Swallows one enemy whole |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Chomper is unique - it instantly kills any regular enemy but then must spend time "digesting," leaving it vulnerable. It excels against waves with few tough enemies but struggles against swarms.

**Optimal Placement**: Second row, protected by Wall-nuts. Never use Chomper alone.

**Best Against**: Armored brainrots, boss enemies, any tough single target.

## Rare Plants

Rare plants are significant investments that provide major power spikes.

### Repeater - The Upgrade

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 40 (2 shots × 20) |
| Attack Speed | 1.5/s |
| DPS | 60 |
| Cost | 200 sun |
| Special | Fires 2 peas per attack |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Repeater is simply a better Peashooter - exactly double the damage for double the cost. It''s the most efficient pure-damage upgrade in the game.

**Optimal Strategy**: Replace Peashooters with Repeaters as you can afford them.

**Mutation Priority**: High. A Frozen Repeater deals 180 DPS - matching Gatling Pea''s base damage.

### Torchwood - The Multiplier

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 0 |
| Cost | 175 sun |
| Special | Doubles damage of all peas passing through |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Torchwood doesn''t attack directly but transforms any pea that passes through it into a fire pea with double damage. This effectively doubles the DPS of every pea-shooting plant in that lane.

**Optimal Placement**: Middle row, with pea shooters behind it.

**Math Example**:
- Gatling Pea behind Torchwood: 80 × 2 = 160 damage per attack
- With 1.5 attacks/second: 240 DPS (doubled from 120!)

## Epic & Legendary Plants

These are the most powerful plants in the game.

### Gatling Pea (Epic)

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 80 (4 shots × 20) |
| Attack Speed | 1.5/s |
| DPS | 120 |
| Cost | 400 sun |
| Special | Fires 4 peas per attack |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Gatling Pea is the highest single-target DPS plant available. Its four-pea burst shreds through individual enemies faster than any other plant.

**Optimal Build**: Gatling Pea + Torchwood = 240 DPS. Add Frozen mutation = 720 DPS!

**Investment Priority**: Gatling Pea should be your primary mutation target.

### Winter Melon (Legendary)

| Stat | Value |
|------|-------|
| Base Damage | 100 |
| Attack Speed | 1.0/s |
| DPS | 100 |
| Cost | 500 sun |
| Special | AoE damage + Heavy Slow |

**In-Depth Analysis**

Winter Melon is considered the best overall plant due to its combination of high damage, AoE attacks that hit multiple enemies, and a powerful slow effect that stacks with other slows.

**Why It''s S-Tier**:
1. AoE means it damages entire waves
2. Heavy slow gives allies more attack time
3. High base damage scales well with mutations
4. Splash damage can''t be blocked

**Pro Strategy**: One Winter Melon per lane, backed by pure DPS plants.

## Mutation Value Rankings

Not all plants benefit equally from mutations. Here''s the optimal priority:

| Priority | Plant | Reason |
|----------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Gatling Pea | Highest base DPS |
| 2 | Winter Melon | AoE multiplier |
| 3 | Repeater | Good value, common |
| 4 | Snow Pea | Utility + damage |
| 5+ | Others | Lower impact |

'# Plants Vs Brainrots - Complete Mutations Guide

Mutations are one of the most powerful systems in Plants Vs Brainrots, capable of transforming ordinary plants into devastating powerhouses. This comprehensive guide explains everything you need to know about obtaining, using, and maximizing mutations.

## What Are Mutations?

Mutations are special variant forms of plants that provide significant combat bonuses. When you plant a new seed, there''s a chance it will spawn as a mutated version with enhanced abilities and unique visual effects.

Mutated plants are permanent - once a plant spawns with a mutation, it keeps that mutation for its entire lifespan. This makes obtaining high-tier mutations on powerful plants one of the most rewarding experiences in the game.

## Mutation Types and Effects

### Normal Plants
- **Multiplier**: 1.0x (no bonus)
- **Visual**: Standard plant appearance
- **Drop Rate**: 85.5%
- **Notes**: Default state for all plants

### Gold Mutation
- **Multiplier**: 1.5x damage
- **Visual**: Golden glow and sparkle effects
- **Drop Rate**: 10%
- **Notes**: Most common mutation, good entry point

Gold mutations are your first taste of enhanced power. While a 50% damage boost might seem modest, it adds up significantly over time. A Gold Gatling Pea goes from 120 DPS to 180 DPS - matching several lower-tier plants combined.

### Diamond Mutation
- **Multiplier**: 2.0x damage
- **Visual**: Blue crystalline sparkles and shine
- **Drop Rate**: 3%
- **Notes**: Significant power spike

Diamond mutations represent a major power increase. Any plant with Diamond mutation becomes immediately viable for endgame content. The visual effects are also stunning, making Diamond-mutated plants easy to identify on the battlefield.

### Neon Mutation
- **Multiplier**: 2.5x damage
- **Visual**: Vibrant glowing outline effect
- **Drop Rate**: 1%
- **Notes**: Rare and highly valuable

Neon mutations are where things get serious. A 2.5x multiplier on a Gatling Pea means 300 DPS from a single plant - more than most players'' entire early-game setups. Neon mutated plants should be protected at all costs.

### Frozen Mutation
- **Multiplier**: 3.0x damage + slow effect
- **Visual**: Ice crystals, frost particles, blue tint
- **Drop Rate**: 0.5%
- **Notes**: Best mutation, extremely rare

Frozen is the ultimate mutation. Not only does it triple your plant''s damage, but it also adds a slowing effect to attacks (even on plants that don''t normally slow). A Frozen Gatling Pea dealing 360 DPS while slowing enemies is absolutely devastating.

## Mutation Mathematics

Understanding the math helps you appreciate mutation value:

### DPS Comparison Table

| Plant | Normal | Gold (1.5x) | Diamond (2x) | Neon (2.5x) | Frozen (3x) |
|-------|--------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Peashooter | 30 | 45 | 60 | 75 | 90 |
| Repeater | 60 | 90 | 120 | 150 | 180 |
| Gatling Pea | 120 | 180 | 240 | 300 | 360 |
| Winter Melon | 100 | 150 | 200 | 250 | 300 |

### Combined Multipliers

Mutations stack multiplicatively with other bonuses:

```
Total DPS = BaseDPS × Mutation × Torchwood × OtherBonuses
```

Example: Frozen Gatling Pea behind Torchwood
- Base: 120 DPS
- Frozen: × 3.0 = 360 DPS
- Torchwood: × 2.0 = 720 DPS

That''s SIX TIMES the normal damage from one plant!

## How to Get Mutations

### Natural Spawning

Every time you plant a seed, there''s a chance for mutation:

| Mutation | Base Chance |
|----------|-------------|
| Gold | 10% |
| Diamond | 3% |
| Neon | 1% |
| Frozen | 0.5% |

On average, you''ll need to plant:
- 10 seeds for 1 Gold
- 33 seeds for 1 Diamond
- 100 seeds for 1 Neon
- 200 seeds for 1 Frozen

### Lucky Potions

Lucky Potions are consumable items that temporarily boost mutation chances. They''re obtained primarily from:

1. **Redeem Codes** - Check [Codes Page](/plants-vs-brainrots/codes) for active codes
2. **Event Rewards** - Limited-time events often give Lucky Potions
3. **Daily Login** - Streak rewards include potions
4. **Shop Purchases** - Can be bought with premium currency

**Lucky Potion Effects**:
- Duration: 10-30 minutes depending on potion type
- Boost: 2x to 5x increased mutation chances
- Stacking: Multiple potions do NOT stack

### Mutation Farming Strategy

Efficient mutation farming requires planning:

1. **Save Lucky Potions** for expensive plant seeds (Gatling Pea, Winter Melon)
2. **Bulk Plant** during potion duration to maximize value
3. **Track Results** to estimate your luck
4. **Target High-Value Plants** - don''t waste potions on Peashooters

## Mutation Priority Guide

Not all mutations are equally valuable. Here''s how to prioritize:

### Top Priority (Always Keep)
- Frozen Gatling Pea
- Frozen Winter Melon
- Neon Gatling Pea
- Neon Winter Melon
- Diamond Gatling Pea

### High Priority (Valuable)
- Any Frozen mutation
- Neon Repeater
- Diamond Winter Melon
- Diamond Repeater

### Medium Priority (Useful)
- Gold on any damage plant
- Diamond Snow Pea
- Neon Peashooter

### Low Priority (Keep if Space)
- Mutations on Wall-nut (no damage anyway)
- Mutations on Sunflower (minimal impact)
- Gold Peashooter (will be replaced)

## Trading Mutated Plants

Mutated plants can be extremely valuable in the trading market:

### Approximate Trade Values

| Item | Relative Value |
|------|----------------|
| Normal Gatling Pea | 1x |
| Gold Gatling Pea | 3-5x |
| Diamond Gatling Pea | 15-25x |
| Neon Gatling Pea | 50-100x |
| Frozen Gatling Pea | 200-500x |

**Trading Tips**:
- Screenshot mutations before trading
- Use official Discord trade channels
- Verify trade partner reputation
- Never trade outside secure systems

## Mutation Preservation

Keep your valuable mutations safe:

1. **Never Dig Up** mutated plants unless absolutely necessary
2. **Protect** high-value mutated plants with Wall-nuts
3. **Position Safely** in back rows when possible
4. **Document** your best mutations (screenshots)

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can mutations change after planting?**
A: No, mutations are permanent once spawned.

**Q: Do mutations affect non-damage abilities?**
A: The damage multiplier only affects damage. However, Frozen mutation adds slowing to any plant.

**Q: What happens if I dig up a mutated plant?**
A: It''s gone forever. You receive no refund and cannot recover mutations.

**Q: Can I reroll mutations?**
A: Some gamepasses allow mutation rerolling, but it''s generally not recommended for high-tier mutations.

**Q: Do mutations stack?**
A: Plants can only have one mutation at a time.
